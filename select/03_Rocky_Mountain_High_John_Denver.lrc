[00:11.69] He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year
[00:17.54] Coming home to a place he'd never been before
[00:23.88] He left yesterday behind him
[00:26.65] You might say he was born again
[00:29.55] You might say he found a key for ev'ry door
[00:35.70] When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
[00:41.39] On the road and hangin' by a song
[00:47.56] But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care
[00:53.34] It keeps changin' fast, and it don't last for long
[00:59.52] But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
[01:05.33] I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[01:11.57] The shadow from the starlight
[01:14.15] Is softer than a lullaby
[01:26.15] 
[01:21.15] Rocky Mountain high
[01:30.65] 
[01:26.80] Rocky Mountain high
[01:36.30] 
[01:33.57] He climbed cathedral mountains
[01:36.11] He saw silver clouds below
[01:39.19] He saw everything as far as you can see
[01:45.07] And they say that he got crazy once
[01:48.09] And he tried to touch the sun
[01:51.07] And he lost a friend but kept his memory
[01:56.53] Now he walks in quiet solitude
[01:59.82] The forests and the streams
[02:02.58] Seeking grace in every step he takes
[02:08.56] His sight has turned inside
[02:10.84] Himself to try and understand
[02:14.07] The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
[02:20.32] And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
[02:25.86] I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[02:32.38] You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
[02:41.07] Rocky Mountain high
[02:50.57] 
[02:47.06] Rocky Mountain high
[02:56.56] 
[02:53.94] Now his life is full of wonder
[02:56.65] But his heart still knows some fear
[02:59.61] Of a simple thing, he cannot comprehend
[03:05.69] Why they try to tear the mountains down
[03:08.64] To bring in a couple more
[03:11.50] More people, more scars upon the land
[03:17.94] And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
[03:23.29] I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[03:29.22] I know he'd be a poor man
[03:32.27] If he never saw an eagle fly
[03:46.27] 
[03:38.56] Rocky Mountain high
[03:42.87] Colorado Rocky Mountain high
[03:48.33] I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
[03:54.36] Friends around the campfire
[03:56.93] Everybody's high
[04:04.93] 
[04:03.62] Rocky Mountain high
[04:13.12] 
[04:09.24] Rocky Mountain high
[04:18.74] 
[04:15.41] Rocky Mountain high
[04:24.91] 
[04:21.21] Rocky Mountain high
[04:30.71] 
[04:27.41] Peace my friend, thank you
[04:33.22] Thank you very much
