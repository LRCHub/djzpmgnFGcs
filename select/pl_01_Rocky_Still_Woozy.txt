I just, I just dream
Dream, dream
I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream
I won't crash your car
What?
if you don't crash mine
And I only feel better
half of the time
When I am sleepin' and
I'm dreamin' in my bed
And I don't know
if I'm awake or I'm dead
I always remember
that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember
that you need me
When I'm nodding off slowly
So I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream
That it isn't how it seems
Seems, seems, seems
Yeah,
we'll be caught up in between
'Tween, 'tween, 'tween, 'tween
And it's only you and me
For the evening
I slept for three days,
officially
Got no idea what you said to me
I go to sleep
so you'll be next to me
I'm not lazy, no
She hit me like that,
you know it's good for me
She got me running back
and accidentally
Wrote a symphony,
when you spoke
I always knew you could go off
I always remember
that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember
that you need me
When I'm nodding off slowly
So I just, I just dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
That it isn't how it seems
Seems, seems, seems
Yeah, we'll be caught up
in between
'Tween, 'tween, 'tween, 'tween
And it's only you and me
For the evening
I always remember
that you love me
When I leave my lonely body
I always remember
that you need me
When I'm nodding off slowly
